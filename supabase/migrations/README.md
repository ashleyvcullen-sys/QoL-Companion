# Migration status

These files are applied **by hand** in the Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor. No
CLI or service-role credential is wired into local tooling, so nothing in this
repo can apply them, and — more importantly — **nothing in this repo can tell
you whether they have been applied.**

Read that second point carefully before flagging a migration as outstanding.
The presence of a file here says nothing about the state of the database. The
only source of truth is the database itself. To check, run this in the SQL
Editor:

```sql
select 'column' as kind, column_name as name
from information_schema.columns
where table_schema = 'public' and table_name = 'bcs_entries'
union all
select 'policy' as kind, policyname as name
from pg_policies
where schemaname = 'public' and tablename = 'bcs_entries'
order by kind, name;
```

## Applied

| Migration | Applied | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| `20260823100000_create_bcs_entries.sql` | 23 Aug 2026 | Query above returned all 7 columns and all 4 `bcs_*_own` policies |
| `20260823110000_add_bcs_weight.sql` | 23 Aug 2026 | `weight_kg` present in the same result |

Both were applied as a single combined paste, which is why the second one
reports as already satisfied if re-run. Both are written to be re-runnable.

Update this table whenever a migration is applied.
